3.I spent about 20 hours and I took a charge in structuring the code. I and Jimmy together thought about what algorithms and datastructures to use for the project. Then we coded together on my laptop so that we could be on the same page. Also, I took charge in 2SAT-satTeam.py which was the last question for the project. This particularly took me long time because not only it was the hardest problem but also I had to combine all the algorithms and datastructures we used previously.
4.I learned the importance of having a teamwork. We were worried at the beginning since we only have two people and I did not know a lot of people because I am an exchanged student from Hong Kong. However, even working as a group of two people, we still managed to finish most of the project and learned a lot of the purpose of this project. Therefore, I truly learned how dedication can make stable outputs rather than having many people on the project.
5.Team dynamics worked well and I had a great team work with Jimmy since we enjoyed this project together. We were a great team member to each other because we could fill each otherâ€™s missing points. Coding on my personal laptop, we could easily discuss the code structures and any missing parts of the codes.
6.I think my role is to basically think about the data structures and use python for our project. Jimmy helped along with this process by pondering together and we were able to finally come up with the product at least. I think we all exceeded expectations by dedicating so much time into this project and more importantly, learning the teamwork. More than doing this project, I am relieved that I made a friend at Notre Dame and I am very satisfied with this project.
