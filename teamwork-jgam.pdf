3.20hours. I worked on specifically brute and backtrack satTeam.py. I went through the problems and talked about the algorithms that I came up with my team member and most of the time spent on which algorithm or approach to use in solving these puzzles. Debugging took long but we were not familiar with python so it was basically tedious work that we had to do.
4. Through this project, I learned the core part of using the right algorithms and data structures. For example, saving variables with different literals, I was able to represent each variable with different numbers. This allowed me to compute everything in a speedier way. It is important to set up the data structures because running the code with mathematical formulas is done properly with the right set up.
5. Team dynamics worked out pretty well and we met up daily basis for about a week to finish this project. This was personally extremely efficient because we could get things done for two-three hours rather than sitting at library and trying to finish the homework at the very last minute. I think the only problem we had still was to run the test at the very last minute so we could start the project early next time to start the project2.
6.My role for this project was to schedule time and general overview of how and where our project is heading to. Also, I thought about big picture of our programs.I truly want to praise and thank Songcheng for generously spending time for this project at unsuitable time. As a senior who transferred from Mechanical Engineering, I am cramping a lot of computer science courses this semester which indicate that there exists every project for every class. Of course the due dates for those projects are within this week and it was very hard for me to find the right time for Theory project. Songcheng was always very supportive of my busy schedule and would wait for me or even start a little bit early on the project so that we could get a headstart on our project. He definitely led our team and exceeded the expectations.
